## Exam Sections

### Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Fundamentals

> Describe the processes suitable for automation and the processes executed with the different robot types; for example, attended verses unattended

#### Attended Robot
* Help individual users with small repetitive tasks
* Processes are triggered by users or specific user events (e.g. _a call is received_)
* Runs on the same machine on which the user performs the tasks

#### Unattended Robot
* Runs long processes or automations without human interaction
* Not dependent on users to trigger processes, as they are controlled through Orchestrator
* Runs on any machine connected to Orchestrator, usually dedicated machines are used

### UiPath Studio Overview
> Explain the debug functions and how they are used; for example, using Breakpoints

#### What is Debugging?

The process of identifying and resolving errors that prevent the project from functioning correctly. It is recommended to perform debugging during the design stage of the automation project, at activity, file and project level. By default, debugging is performed on the local robot.

##### Reference
[https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/about-debugging](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/about-debugging)

#### Start Debugging

The options for running and debugging a file or project are available in the Design and Debug tabs.

* Debug         :   Click Debug or use `F5` to debug the whole project.
* Run           :   Click Run or use `Ctrl + F5` to run the whole project.
* Debug File    :   Click Debug File or use `F6` to debug the current file.
* Run File      :   Click Run File or use `Ctrl + F6` to run the file.
* Stop          :   Click the Stop or use `F12` to exit debug mode and return to design mode.

Note that the default action of the Play button in the Ribbon is Debug Current File.

#### The Debugging Panel

The debugging actions located on both the Design or Debug ribbon tabs. However, the debugging process is not available if project files have validation errors

* Step Into
    * To debug activities one at a time. When triggered, the debugger opens and highlights the activity before it is executed
    * When used with Invoke Workflow File activities, the workflow is opened in a new tab in `ReadOnly` mode and each activity is executed one by one
    * The keyboard shortcut for Step Into is `F11`
* Step Over
    * Does not open the current container. When used, the action debugs the next activity, highlighting containers without opening them
    * Comes in handy for skipping analysis of large containers which are unlikely to trigger any issues during execution
    * The keyboard shortcut for Step Over is `F10`
* Step Out
    * This action is used for stepping out and pausing the execution at the level of the current container. It completes the execution of activities in the current container, before pausing the debugging
    * This option works well with nested sequences
    * The keyboard shortcut for Step Out is `Shift + F11`
* Retry
    * Re-executes the previous activity, and throws the exception if it's encountered again. The exception is highlighted and details about the error are shown in the `Locals` and `Call Stack` panels
* Ignore
    * Ignore an encountered exception and continue the execution from the next activity so that the rest of the workflow can be debugged.
* Restart
    * Available after the exception was thrown and the debug process is paused
    * The action is used for restarting the debugging process from the first activity of the project
* Break
    * Allows you to pause the debugging process at any given amount. The activity which is being debugged remains highlighted when paused. Once this happens, you can choose to Continue, Step Into, Step Over, or Stop the process
    * Recommended to use Break along with Slow Step so that you know exactly when the debugging needs to be paused
* Focus
    * Helps return to the current breakpoint or the activity that caused an error during debugging
* Slow Step
    * Enables to take a closer look at any activity during debugging
    * Can be activated both before or during the debugging process. Activating the action does not pause debugging
    * Comes with 4 different speeds tha range from 1X to 4X with 1X being the slowest
* Execution Trail
* Highlight Elements
* Log Activities
* Continue on Exception
* Picture in Picture
* Remote Debugging
* Open Logs

#### Testing Activities

#### Locals Panel

#### Call Stack Panel

#### Breakpoints Panel
* Breakpoints are used to purposely pause the debugging process on an activity which may trigger execution issues
* Setting a condition and/or hit count turns the simple breakpoint to a conditional breakpoint
* Adding logging results turns the conditional breakpoint in a conditional tracepoint
* Adding only a logging message transforms the breakpoint to a simple tracepoint

#### Watch Panel

#### Immediate Panel
* The Immediate panel is only visible during debugging
* Can be used for inspecting data available at a certain point during debugging

> Understand the significance of connecting an automation project to a version control solution

#### What are version control systems?
* They are tools used by software development teams to manage the collaboration on large projects
* Developing larger projects that require collaboration between multiple users
* Allows developers to track a code change, review the history of the code, and revert to a previous version of the project, if needed

**Benefits**
* Enhanced collaboration                : Team members can work freely on any file at any time and merge the changes into a common version at the right time
* Storing versions                      : Only the current version is stored on the disk, all the others are in the system
* Restoring previous versions           : Restore older versions of the file at any time
* Tracking different project versions   : New versions are usually saved with change descriptions. Versions of the same file can also be compared

**Version Control Available**
* GIT   :   distributed version control system
* TFS   :   centralized version control system
* SVN   :   centralized version control system

#### How to connect to a version control system
1. Go to Home ribbon tab
2. Select Tools
3. Select Plugins
4. Choose Enable

#### GIT
**Cloning a Remote Git Repository**
1. In Team tab, select Clone Repository
2. Select either Use HTTPS or Use SSH
3. Type the Repository URL, and choose an empty Check out directory
4. Select Use Credentials / Use Key
5. Click Open
6. In the Open window, select a project.json file to open in Studio

* Push      :   Will send the changes to the remote repository
* Pull      :   Will get the latest version from the remote repository
* Undo      :   Will revert the changes done after the last commit
* Commit    :   Will save the changes to the local repository

### UiPath Studio â€“ Variables and Arguments

> Describe the different variables' types, how they are used, managed, and the best practice for using the variable scope

#### Variables
* Variables are containers that can hold multiple data entries (values) of the same data type
* The value of a variable can change through an external input, data manipulation, or passing from one activity to another
* Used to store multiple types of data

#### Create Variables
1. Press `Ctrl + K` in an activity input field that requires a variable
2. Select the `Create Variable` option in the Variables panel
3. Press `Ctrl + K` in an input field that requires a variable in the Properties panel
4. By performing right-click in the input field and selecting the `Create Variable` option

##### Reference
[https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/managing-variables](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/managing-variables)

#### Variable Types

1. String
    * A text or string variable is a type of variable that can store only strings
