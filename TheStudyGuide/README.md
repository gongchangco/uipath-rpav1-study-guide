Everything is in the UiPath exam documentation. It's just that finding the answers is hard and hope that it aligns with what you're going to get with on the test.

##Exam Sections

###Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Fundamentals

> Describe the processes suitable for automation and the processes executed with the different robot types; for example, attended verses unattended

**Attended Robot**
* Help individual users with small repetitive tasks
* Processes are triggered by users or specific user events (e.g. _a call is received_)
* Runs on the same machine on which the user performs the tasks

**Unattended Robot**
* Runs long processes or automations without human interaction
* Not dependent on users to trigger processes, as they are controlled through Orchestrator
* Runs on any machine connected to Orchestrator, usually dedicated machines are used

> Explain the functionality and interactions of UiPath products; Studio, Orchestrator, and Assistant

**The BIG three**
1. UiPath Studio
2. UiPath Orchestrator
3. UiPath Robots
